Elevator pitch:

Parse an input resume PDF file (probably read input text to get the file path)
Read job description and/or additional specifications (e.g. job description) via input text (or not, to just get general revision suggestions)
Access the OpenAI LLM through their platform's API, feed user input into LLM
Display LLM suggestions for revision alongside original resume text for comparison (actually generating a PDF with the revisions would be cool but probably difficult)

Rough draft list of classes:

ResumeReview
Contains the main method
ResumeReviewTests
Contains unit tests
ResumeReviewModel
Manages internal state of the program (input and output text for LLM, may need additional logic for prompt engineering) and interacts with the OpenAI API
ResumeReviewView
Reads user input and displays program output
ResumeReviewController
Provides methods that allow the model and view to interact; receives input from view, forwards it to the model as appropriate, and sends resulting output to the view
